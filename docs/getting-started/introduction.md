## Introduction

This straightforward library empowers you to extract specific details about the connection agent, enabling you to enhance the user experience based on connection data. For instance, if you identify a mobile connection, you can prompt the user to download the mobile application if your system supports it. Similarly, you can provide a more tailored experience for Android or iPhone users, distinguish options, menus, and other elements between desktop and mobile users.

Additionally, this library allows you to determine if it is a bot, crawler, or spider. In essence, you have endless possibilities at your disposal.ss methods
