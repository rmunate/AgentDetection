## Installation
To install the library, you can easily do so through Composer.
```shell
composer require rmunate/agent-detection
```

## Introduction
This simple library allows you to obtain specific details about the connection agent, which will enable you to enhance the user experience based on connection data. For example, if you detect that it's a mobile connection, you can invite the user to download the mobile application if your system has one. Similarly, you can offer a more personalized experience for Android or iPhone users, differentiate options, menus, and other elements between desktop and mobile device users.

This library also leverages the functionality of the package [https://github.com/JayBizzle/Crawler-Detect](https://github.com/JayBizzle/Crawler-Detect), allowing you to determine if it's a bot, crawler, or spider. In summary, you have endless possibilities at your disposal.

## Available Methods
Below are the available methods in the library. Make sure you have the latest version installed in your system to use any of the following methods or directives.

### Get Agent
`Agent::get()` returns the current connection agent detected by the server.

```php
use Rmunate\AgentDetection\Agent;

Agent::get();
//"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/116.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

### Validate if it's a Mobile Connection
You can perform this validation from controllers or directly from the view using the provided Blade directive.

```php
use Rmunate\AgentDetection\Agent;

// Detecting the Current Agent
if (Agent::detect()->isMobile()) {
    # It's a Mobile Connection...
} 

// Assigning a Custom Agent
if (Agent::set("Mozilla/5.0...")->isMobile()) {
    # It's a Mobile Connection...
} 
```

Blade Directive: This directive validates the in-use connection agent and, based on this, acts as a condition.

@endIfAgentRemoteIp
```

Blade Directive: This directive validates if the request comes from a specific port.
```php
@ifAgentRemotePort('55660')
    <h1>Authorized Port</h1>
@else
    <h1>Unauthorized Port</h1>
@endIfAgentRemotePort
```

### Get the Client Connection's Operating System
To obtain the name of the client connection's operating system, you can use the following method:

```php
use Rmunate\AgentDetection\Agent;

$os = Agent::detect()->clientOS(); // Mac | Windows...
// It will return the name of the operating system
```

### Get Browser Data
To obtain browser data from the client connection, you can use the following PHP method:

```php
use Rmunate\Server\Agent;

$browser = Agent::detect()->browser();
```
This code will return an array with information about the browser, including the browser name, version, and platform. For example:

```php
array:3 [▼
   "name" => "Apple Safari"
   "version" => "537.36"
   "platform" => "Macintosh"
]
```

### Get Robot Data
To obtain data about any robot that may exist within the client connection, you can use the following PHP method:

```php
use Rmunate\Server\Agent;

//$robotData = $agente = Agent::intersect()->getIfIsCrawler();
//null

$robotData = $agente = Agent::set('Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Sosospider/2.0; +http://help.soso.com/webspider.htm)')->getIfIsCrawler();
// "Sosospider"

```
